### Description

PLEASE REMEMBER TO VOTE! This is a COMPLETE Mp3,CD player. With Screen Effects, ID3, Custom Looks, Different Skins, You name it this Mp3 player has it. I put a ton of time into this thing and i hope you enjoy the source code. I DId all the Art Myself. I DELETED the GREEN SKIN. To make the file small enough to upload. I Borrowed some code for the Screen Effects but i changed it enough for it to be my own. This uses the Windows Media player .Ocx to play the MP3's. You should have no trouble with that.

If you like this PLEASE TAKE 5 SECONDS TO VOTE! Thank you =)
